# ArchAI: A Multi-Purpose Moderation & Utility Project for Social Media Platforms

  

## Introduction:

The internet has made it easier for people to communicate and share information with each other, but it has also brought along its fair share of problems. One of the biggest issues that people face online is harassment and hate speech. Moderation on social media platforms can be difficult to manage, especially for large communities where it can be hard to keep track of everything that's going on. That's where ArchAI comes in - a multi-purpose moderation & utility project designed to integrate into various social media platforms to help create a safe and positive environment for users.

  

## Features:

ArchAI is built to be flexible and can integrate into a wide range of social media platforms and messaging apps. The following are some of the key features that ArchAI offers:

1.  Content moderation with advanced sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique that helps identify the sentiment of a text. ArchAI will use sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment of messages sent by users. Based on the sentiment of the messages, the bot will calculate a trust score for each user. If a user sends too many negative messages, the bot will respond by punishing the user or asking them to act more positively. Positive messages will add +1 to the trust score, while negative messages will deduct -1 from the score. Neutral messages will not affect the score. The implementation of a trust score system can help create a more positive and supportive environment in chat groups.
2.  Global trust score: ArchAI will keep a global trust score of users, to indicate threats and malicious users between chatrooms and even platforms. This system helps to prevent users from causing harm across different platforms and can help to identify potential problem users.
3.  Community-focused chatting ability powered by OpenAI's GPT3: ArchAI's chat feature is powered by OpenAI's GPT3 language model, which can provide a more natural and engaging conversation experience. This feature can help to keep users engaged in conversation and reduce the likelihood of malicious behavior.
4.  Advanced prompt engineering and AIML: ArchAI can perform actions and execute tasks based on input, such as sending images and GIFs. This feature allows users to interact with ArchAI in a more natural and intuitive way.
5.  Image generation with OpenAI's DALL-E: ArchAI can generate images using OpenAI's DALL-E image generation model. This feature can be used to create custom images or graphics for social media posts or messages.
6.  Advanced personality system: ArchAI's personality system allows it to adapt and evolve to each community and individual user. The personality system can either be defined by the community managers, or continuously generated with OpenAI's GPT3 LLM. This feature can help to create a more personalized and engaging experience for users.
7.  Advanced permission system: ArchAI features an advanced permission system that allows for community managers to have complete control and tailor their ArchAI experience to their specific community. The permission system lets community managers change permissions for either groups of people or individual users, and they can toggle access to individual commands to fully tailor it to their community.
8.  Multi-language support: ArchAI supports a wide variety of languages and will, in the future, allow for custom datasets to allow for AI rule breaking detection and analysis.
9.  Scalable: ArchAI is built to scale and runs on powerful hardware provided by Oracle Cloud. This feature ensures that ArchAI can handle large amounts of traffic and users without slowing down or crashing.
10.  Data privacy: ArchAI stores only data that's public to everyone in the communities already. ArchAI is covered by Oracle Cloud's data protection, but also has real-time backups in other parts of the world. Users can always request to get their data erased, or view the data stored about them.
11.  Security is a top priority for ArchAI. We understand the importance of protecting user data and preventing malicious attacks. To that end, we continuously monitor the platform using the latest and greatest autonomous security monitoring software that utilizes AI technology. This advanced security system helps us quickly identify and respond to any potential threats to the platform, ensuring that user data is always safe and secure. Additionally, we adhere to the highest industry standards for data privacy and protection, with all user data securely encrypted and stored in compliance with regulations. Our commitment to security is an ongoing process, and we are dedicated to maintaining the highest level of security for our users.
12.  Machine Learning Models: ArchAI's machine learning models are the backbone of the system, and we take great care in selecting the best models for each task. We use a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning models to provide the best results. Our models are trained on large datasets and are constantly updated to ensure that they are always improving.
13.  Natural Language Processing: Natural language processing is a critical component of ArchAI's functionality. Our NLP models are used to understand user input, generate responses, and analyze sentiment. We use a combination of rule-based systems and deep learning models to achieve the best results.
14.  Prompt Engineering: ArchAI's prompt engineering system allows users to execute a wide variety of tasks with simple commands. Our system uses advanced AIML techniques to understand user input and generate appropriate responses. We are constantly updating and improving our prompt engineering system to provide the best possible experience for our users.
15.  Personality System: ArchAI's personality system is a key differentiator that sets us apart from other AI-powered chatbots. Our system allows ArchAI to adapt and evolve to each community and individual user. We use OpenAI's GPT3 LLM to generate personality traits and characteristics, and our system is designed to learn from user interactions and adjust accordingly.
16.  API Integration: ArchAI is designed to be integrated into various social media platforms, and we provide a NodeJS API for developers to integrate it into their own projects. Our API is well-documented and easy to use, allowing developers to quickly and easily add ArchAI's functionality to their own applications.
17.  Advanced Permission System: ArchAI's advanced permission system allows community managers to have complete control over the ArchAI experience in their communities. Managers can tailor ArchAI's functionality to their specific needs, and can even toggle access to individual commands. This allows for a highly customizable and tailored experience for each community.
18.  Community Focused: ArchAI is designed to be community-focused, with the goal of creating a more positive and supportive environment for users. Our trust score system and content moderation features are designed to promote positive interactions and reduce harmful content. We believe that by creating a more positive environment, we can help to reduce online toxicity and promote healthier interactions.
19.  Multilingual Support: ArchAI supports a wide variety of languages, and we are constantly working to expand our language support. We are also planning to introduce custom datasets to allow for AI rule-breaking detection and analysis in multiple languages.
20.  Continuous Improvement: ArchAI is committed to continuous improvement, and we are constantly working to improve our system and add new features. We listen closely to user feedback and use it to inform our development roadmap. Our goal is to provide the best possible experience for our users and to help create a safer and more supportive online community.
